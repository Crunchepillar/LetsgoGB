## Starter Mons
You are restricted to only choose the middle starter. LetsGoEeveeGB gets Eevee and
LetsGoPikachuGB predictably gets Pikachu. Your rival will get the opposite mon you
do and each time you start a new game he will pick a different party to use with
Pikachu or a different Eeveelution for his Eevee. (There are only 3 parties he can
choose from so don't be surprised to see the same one across multiple games)

## Safari Game Mode
All wild battles are now done in the Safari Game Mode style. The BALL option is now
linked to the player's inventory of Great Balls rather than 30 Safari Balls. Throw
rock and throw bait have been combined into Throw Berry which increases the wild
mon's catch rate for the following 3 turns and negates the flee penalty on the turn
it is first fed. Running will always work so at least caves full of Zubat will be a 
bit less annoying :]

## Imposter Battles
Dittos have been removed from all maps. How will you find one now? Hey, Maybe you're
just imagining things but that wild pokemon doesn't quite look right. Something is 
just.. off. Maybe you should catch it!

## Earning Experience and Money
When catching a wild pokemon all pokemon in your party will gain split XP as though
the party size were 3. Trainer battles work the same as usual. The RELEASE option
in pokecenter boxes has been replaced with TRANSFER which gives the selected pokemon
to Prof Oak in exchange for a random selection of items. There is currently no text
prompt for what goodies you got but hopefully I can change that in the future. You
are always guaranteed at least 1 ball returned from a TRANSFER and one reward item.
Pokemon of at least level 25 earn 1 additional reward and level 50 adds another.

## Pokeball Update
Great Balls are actually re-named to Poke balls because I like it better. They are still
great balls in terms of catch rate, this is a name-only change. All other balls have
been removed from the game (including the master ball). Rather than through new balls,
catch rate is improved passively by the following:
* Each badge adds a medium amount
* Every 8 pokemon registered to the pokedex adds a small amount
* Berries add a large amount

## Known Issues
Legendary Pokemon can flee just like anything else which will clear them from the map.
Always save before trying to capture a legendary. This will be addressed in a future
update.

I haven't actually removed the EXP ALL from the game yet so don't get it. If you do,
the experience formula might break and also your save will break in a future update
when I actually remove it.

If the player has a free slot for a newly captured pokemon it will reward itself with
experience points for its own capture. Yea.. that's weird. I know where the flags are
but I'm currently using a jenky method to make experience work so deal with it.
