Section 0: Starter Mons
	You are restricted to only choose the middle starter. LetsGoEeveeGB gets Eevee and
	LetsGoPikachuGB predictably gets Pikachu. Your rival will get the opposite mon you
	do and each time you start a new game he will pick a different party to use with
	Pikachu or a different Eeveelution for his Eevee. (There are only 3 parties he can
	choose from so don't be surprised to see the same one across multiple games)
	
Section 1: Safari Game Mode
	All wild battles are now done in the Safari Game Mode style. The BALL option is now
	linked to the player's inventory of Great Balls rather than 30 Safari Balls. If there
	are no balls in your inventory you can still throw bait or rocks but doing so is
	almost completely useless due to the base mechanics being awful. These features will
	likely be replaced in a future update. Running will always work so at least caves
	full of Zubat will be a bit less annoying :]
	
Section 1-1: Imposter Battles
	Dittos have been removed from all maps. How will you find one now? Hey, Maybe you're
	just imagining things but that wild pokemon doesn't quite look right. Something is 
	just.. off. Maybe you should catch it!
	
Section 2: Earning Experience and Money
	When catching a wild pokemon all pokemon in your party will gain split XP as though
	the party size were 3. Trainer battles work the same as usual. The RELEASE option
	in pokecenter boxes has been replaced with TRANSFER which gives the selected pokemon
	to Prof Oak in exchange for a random selection of items. There is currently no text
	prompt for what goodies you got but hopefully I can change that in the future. You
	are always guaranteed at 1 ball returned from a TRANSFER.
	
Section 3: Pokeball Update
	Great Balls are actually re-named to Poke ball because I like it better. They are still
	great balls in terms of catch rate, this is a name-only change. All other balls have
	been removed from the game (including the master ball) which means, at present, there
	is no system in place to improve your capture rate except the awful BAIT and ROCK
	options that really suck, seriously, you should probably not use them on anything you
	actually want to catch. 
	
Section 4: Known Issues
	Legendary Pokemon can flee just like anything else which will clear them from the map.
	Always save before trying to capture a legendary. This will be addressed in a future
	update.
	
	I haven't actually removed the EXP ALL from the game yet so don't get it. If you do,
	the experience formula might break and also your save will break in a future update
	when I actually remove it.
	
	If the player has a free slot for a newly captured pokemon it will reward itself with
	experience points for its own capture. Yea.. that's weird. I know where the flags are
	but I'm currently using a jenky method to make experience work so deal with it.

	Also check out the CoolPeoples.md (its a text file)
	Note: 	Saves from regular Red/Blue will not work. I changed the SRAM so it will just say that
			your save is corrupted :[
