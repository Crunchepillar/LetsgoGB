Section 1: Safari Game Mode
	All wild battles are now done in the Safari Game Mode style. The BALL option is now
	linked to the player's inventory of Great Balls rather than 30 Safari Balls. If there
	are no balls in your inventory you can still throw bait or rocks but doing so is
	almost completely useless due to the base mechanics being awful. These features will
	likely be replaced in a future update. Running will always work so at least caves
	full of Zubat will be a bit less annoying :]
	
Section 2: Earning Experience and Money
	When catching a wild pokemon all pokemon in your party will gain split XP as though
	EXP ALL were in effect. Trainer battles work the same as usual. The RELEASE option
	in pokecenter boxes has been replaced with TRANSFER which gives the selected pokemon
	to Prof Oak in exchange for a random selection of items. There is currently no text
	prompt for what goodies you got but hopefully I can change that in the future. Making
	the system work as well as it does was really stressful so I just moved on to other
	features.
	
Section 3: Pokeball Update
	Great Balls are actually re-named to Poke ball because I like it better. They are still
	great balls in terms of catch rate, this is a name-only change. All other balls have
	been removed from the game (including the master ball) which means, at present, there
	is no system in place to improve your capture rate except the awful BAIT and ROCK
	options that really suck, seriously, you should probably not use them on anything you
	actually want to catch.
	
Section 4: Known Issues
	Legendary Pokemon can flee just like anything else which will clear them from the map.
	Always save before trying to capture a legendary. This will be addressed in a future
	update.
	
	When naming a caught pokemon the party will receive experience but the game will load
	the EXP ALL text which it is supposed to ignore. I haven't actually excised this item
	from the game yet so don't use it if you get it from Oak's Aide and ignore the text
	that states EXP ALL is sharing experience after naming a caught pokemon.
	
	If the player has a free slot for a newly captured pokemon it will reward itself with
	experience points for its own capture. Yea.. that's weird. I know where the flags are
	but I'm currently using a jenky method to make experience work so this is a bit of a 
	re-write of that @_@
